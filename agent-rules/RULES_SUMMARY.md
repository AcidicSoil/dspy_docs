# Rules Summary

This repository has been refactored around a DSPy architecture. Key practices inherited from the legacy rules include:

- Structured issue analysis and implementation planning
- Conventional commits with pre-commit checks
- Mandatory documentation updates
- Comprehensive code analysis before merge
- Continuous improvement via feedback loops

Legacy rule files now live in `legacy-rules/`. Active guidance resides in `dspy/`.
