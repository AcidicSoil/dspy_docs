# Legacy Rules

This directory contains the original agent instructions prior to the DSPy refactor. They are preserved for historical reference and auxiliary tooling.

- `global/` – cross-project rules and setup scripts
- `project/` – task‑specific guidelines such as commits, issue analysis, and documentation

These files have not been translated into DSPy signatures. Prefer the new `dspy/` rulebook for active development.
